\title{Plots Survey Data
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Generates a 2d binned surface based on the lat and lon dinstances calculated by surveyDim. It is stored as a matrix and used to estimate the proportions of a survey site that were visited, viewed or missed. It also plots the data onto a Google Earth Map. This requires an API Key which can be obtained and enabled from <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/>.
}
\usage{
plotSurvey(bin_width, srvydetails, waypoint, mapcenter, KEY = NULL, zoom = 16)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{bin_width}{
Specifies bin width in meters.
}
  \item{srvydetails}{
A list containing: track - Lat/lon array generated by surveyDim; lat_dist - Latitudinal distance in meters; lon_dist - Longitudinal distance in meters
    }
  \item{waypoint}{
Lat/lon waypoint data.Set waypoint equal to NULL if no file exists.
}
  \item{mapcenter}{
Center of Google Earth Map which is imported [lon, lat].
}
  \item{KEY}{
API Key: refer to help('register_google'). Default is set to NULL and will not plot a map image.
}
  \item{zoom}{
Amount of zoom when importing Google Earth image. Default is set to 16.
}
  \item{view}{
Specified viewing range which a surveyor had on a survey. Default is set to 2.
}
}
\details{
Go to <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/> for more information on how to obtain and enable a Google API key.
}
\value{
plotSurvey returns a list which consists of:
\item{z }{Data frame object of lat/lon counts per bin.}
\item{bins }{Number of bins in lon and lat direction [1 x 2] array.}
\item{waypoint }{Lat/lon waypoint data.}
